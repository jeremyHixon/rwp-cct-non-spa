## Completed Tasks

### Recent Completions
- **✅ GPT-4o Vision API Implementation - Image Analysis Integration** (Priority: High, Category: Feature)
  - **Issue**: AI responded that it couldn't analyze images despite GPT-4o configuration, revealing that image processing was using placeholder text instead of actual Vision API
  - **Root Cause**: OpenAI Service `analyze_image()` method returned placeholder text and `make_openai_request()` treated images as text appended to prompt instead of using proper Vision API format
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Vision API Integration**: Implemented proper GPT-4o Vision API with base64 image encoding and structured message format
    - **Image Processing Enhancement**: Updated `analyze_image()` method to read, validate, and encode images as base64 with proper MIME type handling
    - **API Request Format**: Modified `make_openai_request()` to use Vision API message structure with content array containing both text and image elements
    - **File Validation**: Added comprehensive image validation for file existence, MIME types, and size limits (20MB Vision API limit)
    - **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling for file operations, encoding issues, and API size constraints
  - **Vision API Message Structure**:
    ```php
    $messages = array(
        array(
            'role' => 'user',
            'content' => array(
                array('type' => 'text', 'text' => $prompt),
                array(
                    'type' => 'image_url',
                    'image_url' => array(
                        'url' => "data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_data}",
                        'detail' => 'auto'
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    );

  - **Issue**: Step 1 validation prevented progression when premium fields (image/URL) were filled, causing "Next" button to remain disabled even with proper description content
  - **Root Cause**: Potential undefined value handling in form state and character count calculation causing validation failures
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - **ContentStep.jsx Fixes**: Added null-safe operators for description field handling (`data.description?.length || 0`)
    - **Form Value Safety**: Added fallback empty strings for description and URL fields to prevent undefined value issues
    - **Validation Logic Enhancement**: Strengthened Step 1 validation in `CaptionGenerator.jsx` to only check description field
    - **Debugging Added**: Temporary console logging to identify validation failure points and confirm premium field independence
