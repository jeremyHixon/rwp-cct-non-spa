## Completed Tasks

### Recent Completions
- **✅ Password Strength API Fix** (Priority: High, Category: Bug)
  - **Issue**: AuthModal making API calls to non-existent `/wp-json/rwp-cct/v1/auth/password-strength` endpoint causing 404 errors
  - **Solution**: Removed API call and simplified password strength to use client-side calculation only
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - Modified `checkPasswordStrength` function to use only `getClientSidePasswordStrength`
    - Eliminated async/await and fetch call to non-existent endpoint
    - Maintained existing password strength indicator with 5-bar visual meter and feedback
    - Preserved all password validation functionality using client-side calculation
  - **Performance Impact**: Eliminated 404 console errors and improved performance by removing unnecessary network calls
  - **Result**: Password strength indicator works correctly without API dependency
- **✅ AuthModal Re-rendering Issue Resolution** (Priority: High, Category: Bug)
  - **Root Cause**: AuthModal component re-rendered on every keystroke due to form state management in parent component
  - **Solution**: Complete component isolation using React.memo and state separation
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - Split AuthModal into isolated form components: LoginForm, RegisterForm, ResetForm
    - Applied React.memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders
    - Moved form state management into individual components (formData isolated per form)
    - AuthModal now only manages visibility, tab state, loading, error, and success states
    - Implemented callback pattern for form submission to prevent parent re-renders
    - Added debug logging to track re-render frequency and triggers
  - **Performance Impact**: Eliminated excessive re-renders, input focus now remains stable during typing
  - **Functionality Preserved**: All authentication features work perfectly with improved UX
- **✅ Authentication Form Input Focus Issue Resolution** (Priority: High, Category: Bug)
  - Fixed critical input focus loss where form inputs lost focus after typing one character
  - Resolved React re-rendering issues caused by excessive state updates in handleInputChange
  - Implemented useCallback for form components (LoginForm, RegisterForm, ResetForm) to prevent recreation
  - Added stable React keys to all form inputs (login-email, login-password, register-email, register-password, reset-email)
  - Optimized state management by batching updates and debouncing password strength checks (300ms delay)
  - Eliminated multiple re-renders by using functional setState and conditional error clearing
  - Added proper cleanup for password strength timeout to prevent memory leaks
  - Result: All three authentication forms now maintain proper input focus during typing
- **✅ Simplified Modal Authentication Forms** (Priority: High, Category: Feature)
  - Replaced complex authentication forms with conversion-optimized versions matching freemium model
  - Registration simplified to email and password only (no first name, last name, or confirm password)
  - Implemented real-time password strength indicator with 5-bar visual meter and feedback
  - Added functional remember me checkbox with localStorage persistence
  - Updated form validation to require 8+ characters with letter + number combination
  - Enhanced password reset form with back-to-login navigation

- **✅ Authentication Modal Display Issue Resolution** (Priority: High, Category: Bug)
  - Fixed authentication modal visibility problems where modal DOM elements were created but not visible
  - Resolved DOM structure mismatch between PHP-generated container and React component wrapper
  - Corrected CSS class toggling mechanism to properly control parent container visibility
